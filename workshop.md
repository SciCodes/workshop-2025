### 2nd SciCodes Collaboration Workshop
#### April 10-11, 2025 &#9830; [Arizona State University Barrett &amp; O'Connor Washington Center](https://washingtondc.asu.edu/barrett-and-oconnor-center)

The [Consortium of Scientific Software Registries and Repositories (SciCodes)](https://scicodes.net) 2nd Collaboration Workshop, scheduled for **April 10-11, 2025 in Washington, DC**, will bring together editors and maintainers from a wide range of scientific software registries and repositories as well as open research software advocates and expert practitioners.

The workshop's primary goals include: 

1. *improve* adoption of and revisit [best practices for research software registries and repositories](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1023)
2. *enable* federated software search and discovery over multiple member resources by exposing [curated, interoperable metadata](https://codemeta.github.io)
3. *advance* published research software quality through cyberinfrastructure that helps research communities adopt FAIR and frictionless software engineering practices
