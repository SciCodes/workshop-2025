# 2nd SciCodes Collaboration Workshop

[Follow us on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/scicodes.bsky.social) #scicodes

The [Consortium of Scientific Software Registries and Repositories (SciCodes)](https://scicodes.net) 2nd Collaboration Workshop, scheduled for **April 10-11, 2025 in Washington, DC**, will bring together editors and maintainers from a wide range of scientific software registries and repositories as well as open research software advocates and expert practitioners.

The workshop's primary goals include: 

1. *improve* adoption of and revisit [best practices for research software registries and repositories](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1023)
2. *enable* federated software search and discovery over multiple member resources by exposing [curated, interoperable metadata](https://codemeta.github.io)
3. *advance* published research software quality through cyberinfrastructure that helps research communities adopt FAIR and frictionless software engineering practices

The [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org) has generously provided funding for the workshop and symposium, and [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu) is providing logistical support and access to its event facilities at the [Barrett &amp; O'Connor Washington Center](https://washingtondc.asu.edu/barrett-and-oconnor-center).

The workshop will also be preceded by a half-day pre-workshop symposium on April 9, 2025, with up to 50 participants to reflect on the current state and future trajectories of the research software ecosystem. 

# Symposium

SciCodes is also hosting a [half-day symposium](symposium.html) on April 9, 2025, "*Building the Future of Research Software*", to invite the research software engineering (RSEng), funder, and science communities to consider challenges and long-term aspirations for research software and computationally assisted science.
