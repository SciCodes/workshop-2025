## Details
The [SciCodes Consortium](https://scicodes.net) is hosting a half-day symposium &quot;*Building the Future of Research Software*&quot; on April 9, 2025 for the research software engineering (RSEng), funder, and science communities to consider challenges and long-term aspirations for research software and computational science. We are particularly interested in how to better support computational reproducibility, research software quality, "frictionless reuse", and advancing how we publish, share, discover, cite, curate, and (*main\|sus*)tain research software.

The symposium will be a hybrid event held in Washington DC (limited to 50 in-person attendees) with remote participation available via Zoom.
This symposium will help guide the development priorities for our science gateways, research software registries and repositories in an immediately following [workshop](workshop.html).

The agenda includes a keynote address by [Katherine Skinner](https://investinopen.org/about/team/katherine/) from [Invest in Open Infrastructure](https://investinopen.org/about/), followed by a panel discussion moderated by [Daniel S. Katz](https://danielskatz.org/) ([NCSA, U. Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/)) with the following panelists:

- [Ana Trišović](https://anatrisovic.com/) ([JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/), [MIT](https://www.csail.mit.edu/))
- [Maxence Azzouz-Thuderoz](https://www.softwareheritage.org/2023/04/06/ambassador-maxence-azzouz-thuderoz/) ([Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/), [swMATH](https://zbmath.org/software/)) 
- [Sandra Gesing](http://sandra-gesing.com/) ([US-RSE](https://us-rse.org), [SDSC](https://www.sdsc.edu)) 
- [Tom Morrell](https://bsky.app/profile/tmorrell.bsky.social) ([Caltech Library](http://data.caltech.edu/), [SciCodes](https://scicodes.net))

Each panelist will give a brief 5-minute presentation; after all panelists have delivered their presentations we will have facilitated open discussion with all attendees, both in-person and remote.

We welcome your voice, [please register here](https://forms.gle/cDg5CV54ovYEZAUx5) to contribute to our efforts to improve the research software ecosystem!
